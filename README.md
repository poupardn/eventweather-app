# eventweather-app - Powered by Eventbrite and Dark Sky

READMEs for setting up the frontend and backend are in the above folders

I created a simple API and front/end to combine data from the two. For the development stack, I chose to use Spring Boot (Java) for the back-end and React (JS) on the frontend. I also utilized the AWS Amplify framework for the front-end to add authorization (backed by AWS Cognito) and S3/CloudFront hosting. The user is greeted with a "Sign In" page from the Amplify framework. The user should select "Create account", and follow the prompts (phone number is required, but does not have to be a real phone number) to register. A valid email address is required and a code will be sent to complete registration. Once created, the user can log in and the browser should prompt for a location, which should be allowed, otherwise a message will display. Once allowed, a list of nearby events from Eventbrite and the weather for those events should be displayed. Once displayed, the user can increase or decrease the radius to retrieve different events. Due to API limiting for Dark Sky, only the "best" (by Evenbrite's API definition) 5 events will show.
